# ITSC-3155-Team-Red-Pandas-FinalProject

This is our final project for ITSC 3155. Our goal was to design a web application that allows users to visualize data and solve some problem. We chose to use a dataset of messages on r/WallStreetBets, and show users trends in stocks being mentioned over time, helping them to understand what stocks are trending, and what stocks could potentially have a spike like in January of 2021. Investing without any research can be very risky, so having at least some information on what stocks could be a good idea to invest in is vital to reducing your risk of financial problems.

We have included documentation of our design process in the Documentation folder where you can see samples of the app, and a more detailed report.
